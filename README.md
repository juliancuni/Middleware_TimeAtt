# Middleware for TimeAttendance
## ArtServis Pilot project
No GUI just a Windows Service.

1. TCP Server listening
2. ZKTeco Client based on ZKTeko SDK Ver 6.3.1.37
3. RestAPI Client to register new TimeAttendances, register and delete users to ZKTeco Device on TCP Commands comming from API to this Middleware. 


This code is a real mess. You're warned!
